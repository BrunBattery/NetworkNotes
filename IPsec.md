## Security features of IPSec
- **Include:**
	- **Data origin authentication**
		- Verifying where packet came from
	- **Data integity**
		- Ensuring packet wasn't changed in transit
	- **Confidentiality**
		- Encryption, preventing packet from being intercepted and read
		- Prevented by limited allowed window
	- Confidentiality is the mainly thought-of core feature
- IPSec uses symmetric key encryption
- Point-to-point tunnels in almost all cases, GETVPN can be P2MP
- Tunnel keys dynamically negotiated through IKE
- IKEv2 is superior but not supported by all platforms

## IPsec Phases
- Two phases:
	- Phase one establishes ISAKMP SA, secure tunnel to negotiate phase two through
	- Phase two establishes IPsec SA, tunnel used to protect actual data traffic
	- **In Phase 1:**
		- Auth usually either PSK (Pre-shared key) or certificate based
		- DH^[Diffie Hellman - asymmetric key algorithm used for IPsec, SSL, SSH and others. Peers create public and private keys, exchange public key and generate symmetric key (shared secret) with peer's private key] used to exchange crypto keys
			- Higher DH number is more secure
		- Encryption algorithms used to protect traffic
			- Possibilities include DES, 3DES, AES-128, AES-256, etc
		- Authentication hashes used to ensure packet wasn't modified in transit
			- IKEv1 supports MD5, SHA-1
		- IKE parameters *must match* in order for phase 1 to complete successfully
		- Main mode and aggressive mode both options for completing this step
			- Main mode preferred as aggressive has security issues
	- **In Phase 2, following are negotiated:**
		- Security protocol
			- ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) or AH (Authentication Header)
			- AH does not support encryption, rarely used
		- Encapsulation modes
			- Tunnel or transport
			- Tunnel adds new IP header, used for actually tunneling traffic
			- Transport mode used for host-to-host applications or combined with GRE which does the tunneling itself
		- Encryption (used for actual data traffic, not just tunnel)
			- DES, 3DES, AES-128, AES-256, etc
		- Authentication (hashing)
			- MD5, SHA, etc
		- Combination of the above called IPsec **Transform Set**
		- Only performed in QM (quick mode)
- UDP 500, 4500 are ports used to establish control plane
	- 4500 is only used with NAT-T^[NAT-Traversal add an additional UDP header which encapsulates the IPsec ESP header. Since this header is not encrypted it allows NAT without breaking packet integrity requirements of IPsec]
- IPsec dataplane uses ports 50 (ESP), 51 (AH) or 4500 with NAT-T

## Useful show/debug commands
- Phases:
	- **Phase 1:**
		- `show crypto isakmp sa` - should show **QM_IDLE** as state and status as **ACTIVE**
		- `debug crypto isakmp`, or `debug crypto condition peer ipv4 <IP>` to debug for one specific peer
	- **Phase 2:**
		- `show crypto ipsec sa [<peer IP>`]
		- `debug crypto ipsec`

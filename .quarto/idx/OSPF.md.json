{"title":"OSPF","markdown":{"yaml":{"title":"OSPF","format":{"html":{"toc":true,"toc-depth":5,"css":"styles.css"}},"editor_options":{"markdown":{"mode":"gfm"}}},"headingText":"General Notes","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n\n- AD 110 for internal & external\n- Multicast **224.0.0.5** for all OSPF routers, **224.0.0.6** for all DR/BDRs, port number **89**\n- Advertises all routes to all nodes in area to build a topology before deciding best path\n- Hello and hold timers must match for adjacency (unlike EIGRP)\n- Adjacency formed, DBD (database descriptor) packet sent describing LSDB (link-state database)\n\t- Once other neighbor determines which LSAs they're missing, LSR (link-state request) packet sent to ask for missing LSAs and sync database\n\t- All OSPF routers in an area must share a common view of the database for OSPF to function\n- **DR/BDR Election**\n\t- No real prepending - the only way to ensure a node does not become DR is by removing it from the election\n\t- This is done with `ip ospf priority 0` under the interface you don't want to become DR/BDR\n- **OSPF LSA Types**\n\t- **Type 1** - Router LSA\n\t\t- Generated by **all OSPF routers**, advertised intra-area, describes routers' own interfaces, neighbors\n\t- **Type 2** - Network LSA\n\t\t- Generated by **DRs**, advertised intra-area, describes routers on its segment\n\t- **Type 3** - Summary LSA\n\t\t- Generated by **ABRs**, advertised inter-area to describe reachable networks to another area\n\t- **Type 4** - ASBR Summary LSA\n\t\t- Generated by **ABRs**, adverised inter-area to describe how to reach an **ASBR** advertising external networks\n\t- **Type 5** - External Summary LSA\n\t\t- Generated by **ASBRs**, advertised inter-area to describe external routes\n\t- **Type 7** - NSSA External Summary LSA\n\t\t- Same as above but generated in a NSSA where Type 5 LSAs are not allowed, reflooded as a Type 5 LSA if recieved by an **ABR**\n- Use `show ip ospf border-routers` to see both ABRs, ASBRs in the OSPF process\n- For point-to-point links, add `ip ospf network point-to-point` under interface to save overhead on DR/BDR election\n\t- Null output after the slash in **State** column of `show ip ospf neighbor` indicates point-to-point link\n- Loopbacks automatically advertised as /32s regardless of subnet mask\n\t- Can make the loopback point-to-point to advertise the full subnet\n- By default all links greater than 100Mbps will have the same reference cost\n\t- To change this, change reference bandwidth under router ospf config with `auto-cost reference bandwidth <value>`\n\t- This should match on all devices in topology to prevent loops, but is not required for adjacency\n- Metric can be modified directly with cost on interface (`ip ospf cost <cost>`), or indirectly by changing interface bandwidth\n- Cost can also be configured per-neighbor under router ospf with `neighbor <ip> cost <cost>`\n- To form a neighborship, area, SN mask, stub flag, authentication and hello/dead timers must match\n- Neighborships in a good state in *2-way* for drothers on broadcast segments or *Full* for all other links\n\t- All other states indicate an issue if they persist\n\t- Stuck in ExStart, Exchange states usually indicates an MTU issue\n\t\n---\n\n#### Features\n\n##### Authentication\n- Supports plaintext (pointless), MD5 & HMAC-SHA auth\n- HMAC-SHA configuration done with key chain in global config\n- MD5 configuration done under interface or for an entire area under `router ospf`\n- Key-id numbers must match for successful auth\n```\nkey chain OSPF_KEYS\n key 1\n  key-string <psk>\n  cryptographic-algorithm hmac-sha-256\n!\nint gi0/0\nip ospf authentication message-digest\nip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 <psk>\n!\nint gi0/1\nip ospf authentication key-chain OSPF_KEYS\n```\n\n##### Summarization\n- Possible only at ABRs, ASBRs\n- To summarize LSA 3 as originated by ABR, use `area <area#> range <ip & mask>`\n\t- The area used in the above command is the area the prefix is originated in - the summary will apply to all areas aside from this\n\t- Can add `not-advertise` prefix to prevent advertising prefixes in range, form of route filtering ^ffa496\n- To summarize LSA 5 at ASBR, use `summary-address <ip & mask>`\n- Leak map can be used to leak longer mask prefixes included in summary\n\t- `summary-address 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 leak-map <route-map>`\n- Null0 installed on router to match summary address for both LSA 3 and LSA 5 summaries\n\n##### Route filtering\n- Inter-area filtering possible only at ABRs, filtering LSA3s\n- Performed with `area <area#> filter-list prefix <prefix-list> [in|out]`\n- Inter-area filtering also possible with area range and `not-advertise` flag as described above\n- Can also use distribute lists to filter inbound into the RIB, **not the OSPF database**\n\t- Can match on many values with route-maps, such as interface, ip address, ip next-hop, ip route-source, metric, route-type and tag\n\t- For example: \n```\naccess-list 3 permit 155.1.146.0\naccess-list 4 permit 155.1.0.4\n!\nroute-map DENY_VLAN146_FROM_R4 deny 10\n match ip address 3\n match ip next-hop 4\n!         \nroute-map DENY_VLAN146_FROM_R4 permit 20\n!\nrouter ospf 1\n distribute-list route-map DENY_VLAN146_FROM_R4 in\n```\n\t- Note again distribute-lists **ONLY AFFECTS LOCAL RIB**, not OSPF database\n\t- Easy to create traffic black holes if not careful with this feature\n\n##### Default routing\n- Can be advertised with `default-information originate [always]`\n- `always` flag allows advertisement even if default not in local route table\n\n##### Stub areas\n- Two types, stubby and totally stubby\n\t- Stubby prevents advertisement of LSA 5 (Externals) into the area\n\t\t- Configured with `area <area#> stub` under router ospf\n\t- Totally stubby prevents advertisements of LSA 3 (summary) & LSA 5 into the area\n\t\t-  Configured with `area <area#> stub no-summary` under router ospf\n\t\t\t- Only ABR needs `no-summary`, rest of area just stub\n- ABR advertises default route into stub area for reachability\n- Must be configured on all routers in stub area\n\n##### NSSA\n- Two types, NSSA and totally NSSA\n\t- NSSA prevents LSA5 advertisements but allows redistribution of externals\n\t\t- Configured with `area <area#> nssa` under router ospf\n\t\t- Does not advertise default route from ABR by default\n\t\t- Can use `area <area#> nssa default-information-originate` to advertise default\n\t- Totally NSSA prevents LSA3, 5 but allows redistribution of externals\n\t\t- Configured with `area <area#> nssa no-summary` under router ospf\n\t\t- Advertises default route from ABR\n- Externals originated in these areas will be LSA7s instead of LSA5s, translated to LSA5 at ABR\n\n##### Virtual links\n- Can be used to repair discontiguous networks or for traffic engineering\n- Under OSPF, configure `area <area#> virtual-link <neighbor RID>` on both nodes\n- The IP used is the **router ID**, not the address used for OSPF peering\n- To keep virtual-links stable, it's a good idea to manually define the router ID (as is best practice anyways) \n- **See Redistribution page for details on that**\n---\n\n#### Useful debugs/show commands\n- `show ip ospf interface brief` - Displays interfaces participating in OSPF, areas, cost, etc\n- `show ip ospf neighbors` - Displays neighbors and neighbor states\n- `show ip ospf database` - Displays OSPF database information\n- `show ip ospf database router self-originate` - Useful to see routes advertised by local device\n- `show ip ospf` - Displays detailed information about OSPF protocols, timers, metric reference values, etc\n- `show ip protocols` - Shows various information about active routing protocols\n- `debug ip ospf adj` - OSPF adjacency formation\n- `debug ip ospf packet` - All OSPF packets\n\n---\n\n#### Standard OSPF Config\n```\nint gi0\nip ospf network point-to-point\nip ospf 1 area 0\n\nrouter ospf 1\n router-id 1.1.1.1\n passive-interface default\n no passive-interface gi0\n network 150.1.5.0 0.0.0.255 area 0\n```"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","filters":["quarto"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":5,"css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"OSPF.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":"solar","fontsize":"1.1em","monofontcolor":"rgb(185, 143, 13)","monobackgroundcolor":"rgb (185, 143, 13)","code-block-bg":true,"code-block-border-left":true,"code-copy":true,"title":"OSPF","editor_options":{"markdown":{"mode":"gfm"}}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}

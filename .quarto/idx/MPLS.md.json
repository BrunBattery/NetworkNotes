**High level steps**\n\t- Establish LSP between PEs using an IGP and LDP\n\t- Exchange routes with customer between PE-CE using IGP or BGP\n\t- Exchange customer routes between PEs with iBGP and an MPLS VPN label using VPNv4 AF (address family)\n\t- Label switch between the PE routers using LDP transport label\n- **MPLS L3VPN details**\n\t- Uses MP-BGP between **PE** (provider edge) routers which tag packets with VPNv4 address\n\t- Uses VRFs to peer with customers over BGP or IGP\n\t- If using IGP instead of BGP for CE peering, must redistribute into BGP VPNv4 AF\n\t- VPNv4 address family in iBGP used to form neighborships and share VPNv4 routes\n\t- VPNv4 neighbor relationships ***must be formed*** from a loopback with a /32 mask\n\t- `next-hop-self` not required when running VPNv4 address family, does it for you automatically\n\t- Combination of RD (route distinguisher) and IPv4 address makes up VPNv4 address\n\t- VPNv4 address only used by MP-BGP, transparent to **P** routers in core\n\t- **PE** routers tag traffic with two MPLS labels, inner **VPN** label defining customer and outer **LDP** label used for label switching\n\t- **P** (provider) routers perform label switching along LSP but do not require MP-BGP, do not read **VPN** labels, only read outer **LDP** label\n\t- **CE** (customer edge) routers - do not see MPLS labels, connect to **PE** routers\n\t- Route reflectors function in the exact same way, still needed for iBGP peering using VPNv4 if not running a full mesh topology\n\t- In order to load balance when using RRs in L3VPN, both routes to the same destination must be using different RDs, otherwise only one best path is chosen\n\t- When running L3VPN via OSPF & CE router is using a VRF with OSPF, `capability vrf-lite` must be entered under router OSPF process or routes will not be installed by OSPF - this is because they have a special 'downward' bit flagged when transiting L3VPN that disallows them to be installed to vrf-aware OSPF to prevent loops in VPNv4 backbone\n- **OSPF Domain-ID**\n\t- OSPF routes redistributed from VRF into VPNv4 BGP will show up as inter-area routes when learned by peers - by default BGP redistributed routes would show up as E2\n\t- However, the above is only true if your OSPF process id (`router ospf <x>`) matches or you manually set the domain-ID\n\t- Domain-ID set with `domain-id <x>` under router ospf\n\t- With domain-ID not matching, OSPF routes will show up as E2\n\t- Can be used for traffic engineering if CE is peering with multiple PEs, as OSPF will always prefer IA routes over E2 routes\n- **OSPF Sham Link**\n\t- Used to allow OSPF routes across L3VPN to show up as intra-area instead of inter-area\n\t- Used in scenarios where CE has a backdoor route to another network connected to the MPLS & MPLS should be preferred\n\t- Configured by creating a /32 loopback route on both PEs, advertising this into BGP within the VRF (NOT VPNv4) and using the `area 1 sham-link <SRC><DST> cost X` command under OSPF\n\t- The loopbacks used for the sham link must not be advertised into the OSPF process\n\t\n---\n\n#### Useful show commands/debugs\n- `show mpls interfaces` - shows interfaces participating in LDP\n- `show mpls ldp neighbor` - shows LDP neighbors\n- `show mpls ldp binding` - shows LDP label bindings to prefixes\n- `show mpls forwarding-table` - shows LFIB\n- `show bgp vpnv4 unicast all` - checking that VPNv4 routes being sent/received\n- `debug mpls ldp transport events` - self-explanatory\n- `debug bgp vpnv4 unicast updates` - useful for troubleshooting VPNv4 issues\n\n---\n\n#### Config\n\n##### Standard MPLS Config\n```\nrouter ospf 1\n mpls ldp autoconfig\n```\n\n##### Extended MPLS Config\n```\nmpls ldp router-id Loopback0

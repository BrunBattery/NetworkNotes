#### General Health
- Meditation and mindfulness training seem to be quite effective at lowering cortisol[^18].
- Exercise (both cardio and lifting weights) improve cognitive function significantly[^19].
- Weightlifting/strength training have strong anti-depressive effects[^25].
- Sauna use has significant health benefits, increasing life span and lowering CVD risk[^29].
- Gaining muscle seems to be just as possible at 85+ as it is at 65-75[^30].

#### Diet & Nutrition
- Coffee is shown to be healthy when consumed in normal amounts, with decreased risk in many health outcomes such as cardiovascular disease[^11]. Having caffeine later in than 1PM can cause sleep issues however.
- The benefit of coffee seems to be largely due to antioxidants contained within[^12]. These make up the majority of antioxidants in standard diets, which is why it's still beneficial to drink decaf.
- Dark chocolate is also very healthy despite the high saturated fat content largely due to high polyphenol content[^17].
- Non-nutritive sweeteners (sucralose, aspartame, etc) can help with weight loss[^24].
- Resistance training is likely better than cardio for weight loss [^13]. This is largely because it burns a similar amount of calories to cardio during training (with the exception of elite endurance athletes) while also requiring more energy for repair afterwards and increasing BMR overall because of larger muscle mass. 
- Interestingly, the body will also begin to compensate more the more exercise you do[^14] (usually by lowering NEAT), so beyond a certain point more exercise might not yield much benefit in terms of weight loss.
- Diet breaks (intermittent dieting) seems to be effective at maintaining BMR compared to baseline calorie restriction when dieting (due to lowering metabolic adaptations to CR), however the effect is isn't hugely substantial (~50cals a day)[^16].
- 40 - 60g of dietary fat generally considered the safe lower limit for hormone production during diet[^1].
- The notion that protein consumption past 30g does not lead to more muscle growth seems to be false - the anabolic window will extend for a longer time frame when higher amounts of protein are consumed. There is likely still benefit to spacing protein out during the day, to a point[^3].
- Protein timing is also largely irrelevant[^22], with total protein consumed being a much more important variable.
- Pre-workout carbs don't seem to do anything for weightlifting[^27] - this makes sense as stored muscle glycogen should be more than sufficient for most anaerobic workouts.
- Beyond beginner muscle gains, bulking too quickly seems to cause more fat gain without any additional muscle gains [^23].
- Cutting calories significantly during deloading may be counter-productive, as muscle growth can occur days (maybe even weeks) after an exercise bout[^28].

#### Exercise & Weightlifting
- Free weights and machines offer similar size gains - strength is specific to certain movement patterns[^2].
- 1-2 minutes of rest seems to be sufficient for hypertrophy[^15]. It's likely more rest time is required for strength, however.
- Resistance training through proper full ROM seems to improve flexibility as much as stretching[^20] - this makes intuitive sense as lifting weights is essentially weighted dynamic stretching.
- Supersets, particularly antagonist supersets, save time and appear to be just as effective for strength and muscle building[^21]. The only downside is greater cardio requirements, although this can be interpreted as a positive as well.
- Another time saving method, drop sets, are also just as effective as straight sets for muscle growth[^26], though they also incur a lot of fatigue.
- Front squats and back squats seem roughly equal when it comes to quad growth[^31].

#### Injury Management
- Injury & risk reduction not shown with limiting round-back lifting[^4].
- Injury risk *is* reduced by increasing sleep to 8 hours[^5], reducing psychological stress[^6], believing your body is not fragile[^7] and proper load management[^8].
- There is no linear relationship between tissue damage and pain - pain can occur without tissue damage and tissue damage can occur without pain[^9].
- After disc herniation, most people experience reabsorption of the disc[^10] without any treatment.

[^9]: Non-symptomatic [disc herniations](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35669019/) are a [good example](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25430861/) of this.
[^10]: Most herniations [resolve on their own](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28072796/), with more severe herniations [slightly less likely](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25009200/) to regress on their own. Even in cases of unresolved herniation, there is no linear relationship between bulging/herniated discs and injury/pain[^9].

[^22]: Protein timing (pre, post workout) had no impact on muscle growth in [this study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38846541/).

[^24]: Tons of studies on this, but here's [one example](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37794246/).
[^25]: Large magnitude depression reduction during [this study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37429171/). Even lower-intensity strength training [shows the same](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9914297/).
[^26]: Drop set [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10390395/).
[^27]: [Pre-workout carb study for crossfit showed no difference](https://www.mdpi.com/2411-5142/9/1/27) - this is probably even more true for most typical strength training routines, as crossfit incurs more of a cardio burden than strength training.

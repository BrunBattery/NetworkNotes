Peers create public and private keys, exchange public key and generate symmetric key (shared secret) with peer's private key] used to exchange crypto keys\n\t\t\t- Higher DH number is more secure\n\t\t- Encryption algorithms used to protect traffic\n\t\t\t- Possibilities include DES, 3DES, AES-128, AES-256, etc\n\t\t- Authentication hashes used to ensure packet wasn't modified in transit\n\t\t\t- IKEv1 supports MD5, SHA-1\n\t\t- IKE parameters *must match* in order for phase 1 to complete successfully\n\t\t- Main mode and aggressive mode both options for completing this step\n\t\t\t- Main mode preferred as aggressive has security issues\n\t- **In Phase 2, following are negotiated:**\n\t\t- Security protocol\n\t\t\t- ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload) or AH (Authentication Header)\n\t\t\t- AH does not support encryption, rarely used\n\t\t- Encapsulation modes\n\t\t\t- Tunnel or transport\n\t\t\t- Tunnel adds new IP header, used for actually tunneling traffic\n\t\t\t- Transport mode used for host-to-host applications or combined with GRE which does the tunneling itself\n\t\t- Encryption (used for actual data traffic, not just tunnel)\n\t\t\t- DES, 3DES, AES-128, AES-256, etc\n\t\t- Authentication (hashing)\n\t\t\t- MD5, SHA, etc\n\t\t- Combination of the above called IPsec **Transform Set**\n\t\t- Only performed in QM (quick mode)\n- UDP 500, 4500 are ports used to establish control plane\n\t- 4500 is only used with NAT-T^[NAT-Traversal add an additional UDP header which encapsulates the IPsec ESP header. Since this header is not encrypted it allows NAT without breaking packet integrity requirements of IPsec]\n- IPsec dataplane uses ports 50 (ESP), 51 (AH) or 4500 with NAT-T\n\n---\n\n## Useful show/debug commands\n- Phases:\n\t- **Phase 1:**\n\t\t- `show crypto isakmp sa` - should show **QM_IDLE** as state and status as **ACTIVE**\n\t\t- `debug crypto isakmp`, or `debug crypto condition peer ipv4 <IP>` to debug for one specific peer\n\t- **Phase 2:**\n\t\t- `show crypto ipsec sa [<peer IP>`]\n\t\t- `debug crypto ipsec`\n\t\t\n---\n\n## Crypto Profile IPSec Config w/ IKEv1 (with & without GRE)\n```   \n    interface Tunnel0  \n\t ip address <ip & mask>\n\t tunnel source <ip>\n\t tunnel destination <ip>\n      \n    crypto isakmp policy 10\n\t encryption aes 256\n\t hash md5\n\t authentication pre-share\n\t group 14\n\t lifetime 3600 \n    !\n    crypto isakmp key <PSK> address <remote outside interface IP with subnet mask>\n    !\n    crypto ipsec transform-set <ts-name> esp-3des esp-md5-hmac\n\t mode transport\n\t !mode tunnel if using VTI\n\t\n\tcrypto ipsec profile <profile-name>\n\t set transform-set <ts-name>\n      \n    interface Tunnel0\n\t tunnel protection ipsec profile <profile-name>\n\t ip mtu 1400\n\t ip tcp adjust-mss 1360\n\t !optionally can define tunnel mode as ipsec to bypass GRE and use VTI - 'tunnel mode ipsec ipv4'\n\t\n\t!note that routing through tunnel must exist for ipsec sa to form - routing not included in config\n\t!can do underlay and overlay routing protocols, static routing, front door vrfs, many options\n```\n\n## Crypto Profile IPSec Config w/ IKEv2 (with & without GRE)\n```   \n    interface Tunnel0  \n\t ip address <ip & mask>\n\t tunnel source <ip>\n\t tunnel destination <ip>\n      \n\tcrypto ikev2 keyring <keyring-name>\n\t peer ANY\n\t address 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 !

filtering traffic as it does not rely on just what ports the traffic is riding on\n\t- Where possible, using 'application-default' under service is also ideal - this will allow only the ports required for this application\n\t- The first few packets will be permitted based on the 6-tuple key[^2] defined by the rule until the app can be identified\n\t- This further reinforces using correct service filtering as otherwise unintended traffic will be permitted (e.g. 'any' service would permit any destination ports until app was identified)\n\n- **URL filtering**\n\t- Only works when used on web traffic (80 & 443)\n\t- Can work even without traffic being decrypted by inspecting the SNI[^3] field of the TLS handshake\n\t- URL filters do not work properly when URLs exist in multiple custom URL groups\n\t\t- When one URL matches multiple categories, this creates unpredictable results with URL filtering[^1]\n\n- **Asymmetric routing**\n\t- By default, PAs will not allow asymmetric traffic between zones - if a PA doesn't get a SYN for the first packet of a TCP handshake, the traffic will be discarded\n\t- You can allow asymmetric traffic[^4], however this is done on a per-zone basis.\n\n- **Proxy-ID**\n\t- Used in VPN configurations where one side is a policy-based VPN (defining interesting traffic, source/destination)\n\t- Palo Alto is strictly a route-based VPN and will by default advertise 0.0.0.0/0 as its interesting traffic - if the other side is policy-based, this won't match and the tunnel will fail to come up unless proxy-id is used\n\n- **Hits on Rules but No Logs**\n\t- Few possible causes for this occurrence\n\t- First, improper log forwarding to Panorama if looking there or no logging on the rule in general\n\t- Second, rule is logging at end and, through gathering more information, the end of the session is marked as hitting another rule - there will still be a hit for the initial connection in this case but no log\n\t- Third, this could be a licensing issue with a VM firewall causing no logs to be generated\n\n---\n- **Useful commands**\n\t- `find command keyword <keyword>` - Allows searching CLI for useful commands\n\t- `show counters global filter yes packet-filter yes delta yes | match drop` - This gives you any drop counters that have incremented since the command was last run and matches the PCAP filter - useful for finding the reason for dropped packets in a PCAP\n\n[^1]: [Attached article](https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id=kA10g000000ClzSCAS) validates this.\n[^2]: The 6-tuple key consists of the following: source-address, destination-address, source-port, destination-port, protocol, and security-zone.\n[^3]: The SNI field (server name indication) is transmitted in clear text during the

Hi all,

I put this site together to host notes created during my time studying for the CCNP ENARSI exam. The CCNP navigation follows the flow of the ENARSI exam blueprint. 

Since then, I've also expanded it to include some Azure notes, some Palo Alto notes and some fitness & lifestyle notes. I hope you find something useful or informative here.

## About me
I'm a network engineer with a passion for learning based in beautiful British Columbia, Canada. Aside from tech, I love weightlifting, hiking and gaming. You can find me on my LinkedIn or on my YouTube channel below.

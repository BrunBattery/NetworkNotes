Notes","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\n\n\n- AD 90 internal, 170 external\n- Multicast **224.0.0.10** standard for hellos, port number **88**\n- Uses **DUAL** (Diffusing Update Algorithm)\n- **K values** (metric parameters) *must match* for neighbor relationship to form\n\t- K values set with the `metric weights` command - should be left default\n\t- By default uses bandwidth (slowest in path) & delay (cumulative) to compose metric\n- Only advertises best routes, all others not advertised\n- Hello and hold timers do not need to match for adjacency (unlike OSPF)\n- Can manually define neighbors (like in BGP) to send hellos unicast instead of multicast\n- **Successor route** - best path\n- **Successor** - First next-hop along successor route\n- Config can be performed classic (`route eigrp 100`) or named (`router eigrp <name>`) modes\n\t- Can convert to named mode with `eigrp upgrade-cli`, hitless conversion\n- Only IGP that can do unequal cost load-balancing\n\t- All

must be shorter than feasible distance (**FD** - distance locally) to prevent loops\n\t- If conditions passed, route is considered feasible successor and included in EIGRP topology table for fast failover in reconvergence event\n- When using named-mode in IPv6, all interfaces automatically advertised into EIGRP when address-family initiated\n\t- Can be shut down individually or under `af-interface default` with `shutdown`, then `no shutdown` under interfaces you want advertised\n\t\n---\n\n#### Features\n\n##### Authentication\n- Supports both MD5 & SHA-256 auth (named) or just MD5 (classic)\n- MD5 configuration done with key chain in global config\n- Key-id numbers must match for successful auth\n- Applied under physical interfaces in classic mode or af-interfaces in named mode\n```\nkey chain MD5_KEYS\n key 1\n  key-string MD5_PASS\n!\nrouter eigrp MULTI-AF\n !\n address-family ipv4 unicast autonomous-system 100\n  !\n  af-interface default\n   authentication mode hmac-sha-256 SHA_DEFAULT\n  exit-af-interface\n  !\n  af-interface GigabitEthernet1.58\n   authentication mode md5\n   authentication key-chain MD5_KEYS\n  exit-af-interface\n```\n\n##### Summarization\n- Possible anywhere in topology\n- Configured with `summary-address <network> <mask>` under af-interface in named mode, under physical interface in classic mode\n- Leak map can be used to leak longer mask prefixes included in summary\n\t- `summary-address 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 leak-map <route-map>`\n- Null0 installed on router to match summary address to prevent loops\n- Can define metric on summary-address with the `summary-metric` command under topology base\n\n##### Route filtering\n- Possible anywhere in topology\n- Commonly performed with `distribute-list prefix <prefix-list> <in/out> <interface>`\n- Can also use route-maps to match on tags, metric\n\t- For example: \n```\nroute-map FILTER_ON_TAGS deny 10\n match tag 4\n!\nroute-map FILTER_ON_TAGS permit 20\n!\nrouter eigrp 100\n distribute-list route-map FILTER_ON_TAGS in\n```\n\n##### Split horizon\n- Prevents advertisements of prefixes out same interface they're received\n- Used for loop prevention (along with feasibility condition, router-id)\n- Can turn off (useful for hub & spoke) with `no ip split-horizon eigrp <AS>`\n\n##### Default routing\n- Can be advertised with quad 0 summary route under interface\n- Can also be redistributed from static route\n\n##### Stub\n- Prevents advertisment of anything other than connected routes *by default*\n- Prevents site from being used for transit\n- Breaks query domain\n- Best used when sites have no downstream neighbors\n- Can use leak-maps to advertise normally suppressed routes\n\n##### Stub-site\n- Allows advertisement of routes learned on LAN but not WAN interfaces\n- Limits EIGRP query-domain and prevents site from being used for transit\n- Enabled with `eigrp stub-site`\n\t- Mutually exclusive with `eigrp stub`\n- Interfaces towards hub/WAN identified with `stub-site wan-interface` under af-interface\n\n##### Offset-lists\n- Can be used to increase metric for a specific route/interface\n- Configured under topology base with:\n\t- `offset-list <access-list> in <metric> <interface>`\n\n##### Redistribution\n- See [Redistribution](Redistribution.md) page for details on that\n\n---\n\n#### Useful debug/show commands\n\n- `show ip eigrp interface brief` - Displays interfaces participating in EIGRP, RTT, pending routes, etc\n- `show ip eigrp neighbors` - Displays neighbors and neighbor states\n- `show ip eigrp topology all-links` - Displays EIGRP topology table, successors, feasible successors\n- `show ip protocols` - Shows various information about active routing protocols\n- `debug eigrp packet` - Debugs basically everything EIGRP\n- `access-list 111 permit eigrp any any`, followed by `debug ip packet detail 111` - for packet debugging\n\n---\n\n#### Standard EIGRP Config\n\n```\nrouter eigrp NAME\n !\n
